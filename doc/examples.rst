Examples
=============

Examples are contained in the /torchami/examples folder.  They can be compiled and run using the same procedure as for the main code.  The relative path to /torchami/install is set by default.  Examples are explained in detail in the code paper and contain additional comments and timing information that may be helpful.  Compilation of the examples follows:  


		::
		
		 $ cd examples
		 $ mkdir build && cd build
		 $ sh ../compile.sh
		 $ make
		 $ ./examples
